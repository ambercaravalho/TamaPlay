## Overview üéÆ

I've fallen in love with Panic's [Playdate](https://play.date), and like pretty much everyone who's touched the thing, I wanted to try my hand at game development! The Playdate has plenty of parallels to the original [Tamagotchi](https://tamagotchi.fandom.com/wiki/Tamagotchi_(1996_Pet)) (read: it's a cute handheld), so I chose to natively remake generation 1 for this device.

## Methodology ü§î

Look, the goal of this project isn't to create an incredibly polished game with well-written code. I am simply messing around with the Playdate and learning a little bit about Lua and game development along the way! That being said, feel free to open [issues](https://github.com/ambercaravalho/TamaPlay/issues) if y'all find something that's broken.
